# NETWORKING BASICS
* Networking involves the practice of connecting computers, servers, printers, and other devices to create a network that allows them to communicate and share data.
* Networks can be small-scale, such as a home or office network, or large-scale, like the internet.

## Key concepts
* Protocols: Protocols are rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and SMTP.

* IP Addressing: IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network. They are used to route data packets to their destination.

* Subnetting: Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks to improve efficiency and security.

* Routing: Routing involves directing data packets between networks using routers. Routing protocols like OSPF and BGP are used to determine the best paths for data to travel.

* Switching: Switches are devices that connect devices within a network. They use MAC addresses to forward data packets to the correct destination.

## Networking layers
* OSI Model: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a network into seven layers, from physical to application layer.

* TCP/IP Model: The TCP/IP model is a simpler, four-layer model that corresponds closely to the internet protocol suite.

## Networking devices
* Routers: Routers are devices that forward data packets between networks. They operate at the network layer of the OSI model.

* Switches: Switches are devices that connect devices within a local area network (LAN). They operate at the data link layer of the OSI model.

* Firewalls: Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## Network services
* DNS (Domain Name System): DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using human-readable names.

* DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters to devices on a network.

* VPN (Virtual Private Network): VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over a public network, allowing users to access private networks remotely.

## Networking Technologies:
* Ethernet: Ethernet is a widely used networking technology that defines how data is transmitted over wired networks.

* Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network using radio waves.

## Network Security:
* Encryption: Encryption is used to secure data by encoding it in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.

* Firewalls: Firewalls protect networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

* Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): IDS/IPS systems monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and take action to prevent security breaches.
