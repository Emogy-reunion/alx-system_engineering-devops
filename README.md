#BASH SCRIPTING

* Bash scripting refers to the process of writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language, which is the default shell for most Linux and Unix-like operating systems.
* Bash scripting allows users to automate repetitive tasks, execute commands, manipulate files and directories, and perform various system operations through scripts.
* Bash scripts are plain text files containing a series of commands that the Bash shell interprets and executes sequentially. These scripts can include variables, control structures like loops and conditional statements, functions, and command-line arguments, making them powerful tools for system administration, software development, and automation tasks.

1. Syntax: Bash scripts use a syntax similar to other programming languages, including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and comments.

2. Variables: Variables in Bash are defined without specifying their data types and can store strings, integers, arrays, etc.

3. Control Structures: Bash supports control structures like if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and case statements for decision making and looping.

4. Functions: Functions in Bash allow you to encapsulate code for reuse and modularity within scripts.

5. Input/Output: Bash scripts can interact with users through standard input/output streams and command-line arguments.

6. File Handling: Bash provides various commands and operators for file manipulation, such as creating, copying, moving, deleting files, and reading/writing to files.

7. Error Handling: Bash scripts can handle errors and exceptions using techniques like exit codes, error messages, and error handling constructs.

8. Environment Variables: Bash allows access to system environment variables and provides mechanisms for setting and using custom environment variables within scripts.

9. Debugging: Bash provides tools for debugging scripts, including error messages, tracing, and debugging flags

10. Portability: While Bash is the default shell on many Unix-like systems, scripts should aim for portability by adhering to POSIX standards to ensure compatibility across different environments.

* Mastering Bash scripting can greatly enhance productivity and efficiency in managing and automating tasks on Unix-based systems.
