#System DEVops
* This repo contains skills needed in system devops e.g bash scripting, Networking

* System DevOps, often referred to as "SysDevOps," combines elements of system administration (SysAdmin) with DevOps practices to improve the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of IT operations
* It focuses on automating tasks, streamlining processes, and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams to achieve continuous delivery and deployment.
* Here's a discussion of key aspects and practices in System DevOps:
 1. Automation: Automation is a cornerstone of System DevOps. It involves using tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as provisioning servers, configuring infrastructure, deploying applications, and monitoring system performance. 
* By automating these tasks, SysDevOps teams can reduce manual errors, accelerate deployment cycles, and increase overall efficiency.

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and version control systems.

3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD is a set of practices for automating the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production environments.
* In System DevOps, CI/CD pipelines are used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for infrastructure and system configurations, as well as application code.
* In System DevOps, CI/CD pipelines are used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for infrastructure and system configurations, as well as application code. 
* This enables teams to release changes quickly, reliably, and frequently while maintaining quality and stability.

* Below are areas covered in this repo

##BASH SCRIPTING

* Bash scripting refers to the process of writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language, which is the default shell for most Linux and Unix-like operating systems.
* Bash scripting allows users to automate repetitive tasks, execute commands, manipulate files and directories, and perform various system operations through scripts.
* Bash scripts are plain text files containing a series of commands that the Bash shell interprets and executes sequentially. These scripts can include variables, control structures like loops and conditional statements, functions, and command-line arguments, making them powerful tools for system administration, software development, and automation tasks.

1. Syntax: Bash scripts use a syntax similar to other programming languages, including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and comments.

2. Variables: Variables in Bash are defined without specifying their data types and can store strings, integers, arrays, etc.

3. Control Structures: Bash supports control structures like if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and case statements for decision making and looping.

4. Functions: Functions in Bash allow you to encapsulate code for reuse and modularity within scripts.

5. Input/Output: Bash scripts can interact with users through standard input/output streams and command-line arguments.

6. File Handling: Bash provides various commands and operators for file manipulation, such as creating, copying, moving, deleting files, and reading/writing to files.

7. Error Handling: Bash scripts can handle errors and exceptions using techniques like exit codes, error messages, and error handling constructs.

8. Environment Variables: Bash allows access to system environment variables and provides mechanisms for setting and using custom environment variables within scripts.

9. Debugging: Bash provides tools for debugging scripts, including error messages, tracing, and debugging flags

10. Portability: While Bash is the default shell on many Unix-like systems, scripts should aim for portability by adhering to POSIX standards to ensure compatibility across different environments.

* Mastering Bash scripting can greatly enhance productivity and efficiency in managing and automating tasks on Unix-based systems.

## Networking
* Networking plays a crucial role in System DevOps, as it enables communication and connectivity between various components of the infrastructure, such as servers, applications, services, and users.
