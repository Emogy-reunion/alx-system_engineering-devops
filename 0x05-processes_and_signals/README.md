* Signals can be sent by the kernel, other processes, or users to control or notify a process of events such as interrupts, errors, or requests for termination
* Common signals include SIGKILL for immediate termination and SIGTERM for graceful termination. Processes can handle signals by defining signal handlers, which are functions that specify how the process should respond when a particular signal is received.
