## BASH SCRIPTING

#Bash scripting refers to the process of writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language, which is the default shell for most Linux and Unix-like operating systems. Bash scripting allows users to automate repetitive tasks, execute commands, manipulate files and directories, and perform various system operations through scripts.
#Bash scripts are plain text files containing a series of commands that the Bash shell interprets and executes sequentially. These scripts can include variables, control structures like loops and conditional statements, functions, and command-line arguments, making them powerful tools for system administration, software development, and automation tasks.
